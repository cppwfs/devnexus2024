# Zero to Implementation in 50 Minutes, No Kidding!

The purpose of this presentation is to show how a user can add new functional and non functional features from github repositories that are curated to help speed up development when developing their applications.  
Each project in this repository adds a new feature to the application that is required for it to get to a production environment.
